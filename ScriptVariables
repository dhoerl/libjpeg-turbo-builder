# This file gets imorted by the shell and contains the data needed to build the final libjpegturbo libary for various ios processors and the mac
# Look in the build phase for the Run Script that does all the work.
# When this script finishes, if successful it will create a fat libjpegturbo.a file in the current project directory, which you can link to from one or more apps

# Many of these variables are set by Xcode, so check  "Show Environmental Variables in Build Log" in the Run Script window
# Either set the tagged version here, or comment it out with a leading '#' to get the latest svn code
