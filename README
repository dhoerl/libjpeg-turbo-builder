The current version of the archive in this repository is 2.0.4
You can just grab it, libturbojpeg.a (with arm64, x86_64) or build it from scratch.

BUILDING FROM SCRATCH:

1) Set the desired version (branch) in ScriptVariables, or set it to "master" for latest

2) ScriptRunner will try to pull the lastest source into a sub directory, libjpeg-turbo.

3) If you want a simulator archive that uses SIMD, then you need to install yasm (see libturbo README),
   which Homebrew currently installs as /usr/local/bin/yasm. Otherwise a "C" only version is build
   (which really should be just fine).

4) You should now have a libturbojpeg.a in the project directory, the pre-existing one is deleted.
