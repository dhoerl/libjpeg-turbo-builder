This project has been almost totally redone since it was crated a decade ago.
The latest libturbojpeg build process has changed greatly, its now hosted on github
and this project basically uses scripts created by DRC to build for iOS and the Simulator.

NOTE: Xcode 11.4-beta complains about the current official Simulator slice in the offical
  binaries, and fails with a hard error! If you want to use libturbojpeg get it here,
  or use the project to build from scratch.

The current version of the archive in this repository is 2.0.4
You can just grab it, libturbojpeg.a (with arm64, x86_64) or build it from scratch.

BUILDING FROM SCRATCH:

1) Set the desired version (branch) in ScriptVariables, or set it to "master" for latest

2) ScriptRunner will try to pull the lastest source into a sub directory, libjpeg-turbo.

3) If you want a simulator archive that uses SIMD, then you need to install yasm (see libturbo README),
   which Homebrew currently installs as /usr/local/bin/yasm. Otherwise a "C" only version is build
   (which really should be just fine).

4) You should now have a libturbojpeg.a in the project directory, the pre-existing one is deleted.
